# To-do List 

To-do List made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This project was my first real aplication of Javascript in a web development project. 
I decided to do a to-do list so i could practice:

* Using selectors to manipulate elements in the DOM

* interaction between HTML forms and Javascript

* Understanding about API Web Storage, specially localStorage and it's capabilities
